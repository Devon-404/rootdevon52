    <h1>Welcome To My LIA Project</h1>
    <p>
      My plan is to make a concept motorcycle and make it as realistic as possible by using the 3d sketch option in Fusion 360,
      having a reference image to help me design a rough outline and then adding my own little tweaks to the bike.
      Originally I wanted to make a GSXR-1000 but I decided to do a hybrid of a R1M and a CBR 600 to make it an original concept.
      As for my story brief, I've seen many videos online of "backroom" edits, and I wanted to put my own twist on it. Usually, it's a monster chasing the character, but I wanted to design an audio where the bike is the monster, hence the eerie audio.
