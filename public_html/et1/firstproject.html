            The first thing I did was sketch a moterycle helmet and try to get it as nice as possible so i can have a good base for sketching on fusion 360.

            Next I did my best on emmulating in on the fusion 360 software. It didnt come out the way I wanted but it was my first time using fusion 360.

        Next i extruded my sketch and added details that i wanted to add. I added the number 24 becasue it was my first football jersey that i wore for 4 years. I didnt add more because i didnt want to make the helmet to busy.

    The next step was to slice and print. Once it was printed this is how it turned out!
